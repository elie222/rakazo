 * Restricted egress is enforced by host firewall rules the supervisor cannot see
 * (infra/compose/restrict-computer-egress.sh); without them a restricted computer
 * network is as open as any other. Before the first restricted computer starts, a
 * throwaway container on a `rakazo-c*` bridge tries TCP to that bridge's gateway,
 * which is the Docker host. The ruleset's INPUT drop makes every attempt time out;
 * a refused or accepted connection means the host answered, so the rules are missing.
 * The script inserts that INPUT drop after its DOCKER-USER destination drops, so it
 * stands in for the forwarded rules. The forwarded path is also checked directly
 * against the cloud metadata endpoint: where one exists it accepts connections unless
 * the drop is in place, and elsewhere nothing answers, so only a connection fails.
 * Explicit computer DNS is forwarded from the computer's network, where the ruleset drops
 * private resolvers, so at least one configured IPv4 server must answer a query from the
 * bridge (which has no IPv6). Any reply counts, so a resolver that only knows internal
 * names still passes.
