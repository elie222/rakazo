# Run dispatch and response timing

The API commits messages and runs to Postgres. `RunJobPublisher` records an optional
wake time on the run and publishes a notification through the existing realtime
connection. It does not enqueue agent execution in Graphile.

Worker processes subscribe to notifications and scan runnable rows at startup and
every five seconds. Notifications are hints: a commit without a notification, a
listener reconnect, or an expired execution lease is recovered by the scan. Workers
claim runs using the executor's existing atomic lease and fence checks. Several
claims can start concurrently; model streams and tools run independently after
durable ownership and heartbeats are established. Memory admission and graceful
shutdown are shared with legacy queue deliveries.

Runs waiting behind another run's live computer lease stay queued without repeated
claims. The recovery scan picks them up after release or expiry, while unrelated
bots can run. Execution timing starts after computer ownership is acquired.

Graphile remains responsible for scheduled and maintenance jobs. Those jobs can
create runs, which use the same direct dispatch path. Legacy run deliveries remain
supported during rolling upgrades and drain safely against the same database
claims. Pending legacy retry times are carried into the new run schedule by the
additive migration. A compatibility trigger also stamps retry backoff when an
older worker requeues after the migration; explicit new-worker schedules take
precedence. Remove that trigger only after those older releases have drained.
Embedded installations using the memory job driver retain their
existing dispatch and recovery behavior.

## Timing

Structured logs emit `run.execution_started`, `run.first_response`, and
`run.finished`. Timing fields contain durations in milliseconds:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `run.pre_run_wait_ms` | Source message to run creation, including steering held behind earlier work. |
| `run.queue_wait_ms` | Run creation to its first execution start. |
| `run.first_response_ms` | Source message to first persisted visible reply text or reply card. |
| `run.total_ms` | Source message to run completion or failure. |
| `run.execution_wall_ms` | First execution start to completion, including retries and human waits. |

These are run-level measurements. Multiple steering messages can share one run;
its selected source message defines the timing origin. When a run has no source
message, its creation time is the origin. Missing start,
response, or completion timestamps omit the corresponding duration rather than
reporting zero. Use `run.trigger` and `run.outcome` to distinguish interactive,
scheduled, successful, and failed work. Use each run's first-response record for
response latency distributions and its terminal record for total duration; do not
mix timing fields repeated on different lifecycle events as independent samples.

The first response timestamp is persisted in the same transaction as its output
and is preserved across attempts, restarts, and resumes. Streamed text, final-only
replies, message tools, and reply cards count. Reasoning, working placeholders,
activity-only progress, and hidden metadata do not. Timing adds no message content
or new personal identifiers to logs. A timing-log read failure cannot fail an
already committed operation.

These are server-side availability measurements. They do not measure network
delivery or rendering on a user's device. Client delivery/render timing would need
a separate acknowledgement.
