# Run dispatch and response timing

The API commits messages and runs to Postgres. `RunJobPublisher` records an optional
wake time on the run and publishes a notification through the existing realtime
connection. It does not enqueue agent execution in Graphile.

Worker processes subscribe to notifications and scan runnable rows at startup and
every five seconds. Notifications are hints: a commit without a notification, a
listener reconnect, or an expired execution lease is recovered by the scan. Workers
claim runs using the executor's existing atomic lease and fence checks. Several
claims can start concurrently; model streams and tools run independently after
durable ownership and heartbeats are established. Memory admission and graceful
shutdown are shared with legacy queue deliveries.

Runs waiting behind another run's live computer lease stay queued without repeated
claims. The recovery scan picks them up after release or expiry, while unrelated
bots can run. Execution timing starts after computer ownership is acquired.

Graphile remains responsible for scheduled and maintenance jobs. Those jobs can
create runs, which use the same direct dispatch path. Legacy run deliveries remain
supported during rolling upgrades and drain safely against the same database
claims. Pending legacy retry times are carried into the new run schedule by the
additive migration. A compatibility trigger also stamps retry backoff when an
older worker requeues after the migration; explicit new-worker schedules take
precedence. Remove that trigger only after those older releases have drained.
Embedded installations using the memory job driver retain their
existing dispatch and recovery behavior.

## Timing

Structured logs emit `run.execution_started`, `run.first_response`, and
`run.finished`. Timing fields contain durations in milliseconds:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `run.pre_run_wait_ms` | Source message to run creation, including steering held behind earlier work. |
| `run.queue_wait_ms` | Run creation to its first execution start. |
| `run.first_response_ms` | Source message to first persisted visible reply text or reply card. |
| `run.total_ms` | Source message to run completion or failure. |
| `run.execution_wall_ms` | First execution start to completion, including retries and human waits. |

These are run-level measurements. Multiple steering messages can share one run;
its selected source message defines the timing origin. When a run has no source
message, its creation time is the origin. Missing start,
response, or completion timestamps omit the corresponding duration rather than
reporting zero. Use `run.trigger` and `run.outcome` to distinguish interactive,
scheduled, successful, and failed work. Use each run's first-response record for
response latency distributions and its terminal record for total duration; do not
mix timing fields repeated on different lifecycle events as independent samples.

The first response timestamp is persisted in the same transaction as its output
and is preserved across attempts, restarts, and resumes. Streamed text, final-only
replies, message tools, and reply cards count. Reasoning, working placeholders,
activity-only progress, and hidden metadata do not. Timing adds no message content
or new personal identifiers to logs. A timing-log read failure cannot fail an
already committed operation.

These are server-side availability measurements. They do not measure network
delivery or rendering on a user's device. Client delivery/render timing would need
a separate acknowledgement.

Recurring timer routines mark their origin durably and keep one pristine pending
catch-up run for the same routine, prompt, thread, and model selection. A later
tick reuses that pending work and advances the next scheduled tick, preserving
any computer retry delay. Already started runs, manual tests, explicit retries,
one-shot schedules, and change/event-triggered runs remain separate. Unmarked
older firings are preserved: a scheduled firing event alone cannot distinguish
recurring work from a one-shot whose routine was later edited.
A bounded pass cancels redundant marked timer rows with no attempts, effects,
output, steering, checkpoint, or live computer ownership, preserving historical
rows and terminal events. The `routine.coalesced` log records reuse without
another `routine.fired` event.
Committed timer runs and their advanced schedules remain intact when publication
fails. Recovery repairs delivery for every driver; a notification failure never
rolls back work that another tick or dispatcher can already own.

Interactive work is scanned before scheduled/reaction work in each bounded pass.
When memory admission declines a run, dispatch leaves it durable and continues
scanning instead of waiting in a dispatch slot. Memory admission independently
checks available physical memory and unused JavaScript heap space against the
same small attachment startup buffer. External buffers are not counted against
the JavaScript heap limit, and live-run counts do not set a concurrency limit.
Notifications and periodic recovery reopen completed lanes without restarting
active pagination. Active model streams have no new duration limit.

`run.admission_wait` and `run.admission_resumed` identify a capacity episode and
its duration without logging every retry. Independently, `run.queue_delayed`
warns every thirty seconds when interactive runs have been due and queued for
at least thirty seconds, measured from the later of creation and wake time.
Normal retry backoff does not count toward this wait. It includes `queue.delayed_runs` and
`queue.oldest_wait_ms`; `run.queue_recovered` marks recovery. Future retries and
scheduled work do not trigger this warning. These checks do not block dispatch.

For optional Axiom monitoring, alert when the following query returns any events
in the last two minutes (use the deployment's configured dataset):

```apl
['YOUR_DATASET']
| where message == "run.queue_delayed"
| summarize warnings = count()
| where warnings > 0
```

The application emits the signal; notification routing belongs in the deployment's
monitor configuration. No hosted monitoring service is required for dispatch.
