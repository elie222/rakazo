export const PAGE_KIT_GUIDE = `# Pages

A page is JSX source whose default export is a React component. It renders in an isolated viewer in the user's light or dark theme and prints cleanly.

## Rules
- Everything below is already in scope: React, Fragment, useState, useMemo, useEffect, useRef, useCallback, useReducer, the kit components and its helpers. Imports are optional; only "react" and "rakazo/page" (the kit) are allowed. No require, network or CSS files.
- Exactly one \`export default\` (your top component). Helper components and data objects in the same file are fine.
- Do not name your own component after a kit component (Page, Status, Table, Rows...): it replaces the kit's in the whole file, so using that kit component inside it renders itself forever, and the check refuses it. Call it StatusPage, BotTable and so on.
- Gather data first and keep it in one object at the top. Write figures already formatted ("$12,400", "4.8%") and write plain characters, not HTML escapes ("<800ms", not "&lt;800ms").
- Plain HTML and SVG elements (div, span, svg, path, rect, circle, text, linearGradient, animate...) with style={{...}} are allowed for custom visuals; take colours from useTheme() so they match both themes. script, style, iframe, object, embed and foreignObject are not allowed, and handlers are functions, never strings. Images are data: URIs only.
- Create it with create_page {title, source}. To change it later, pass the pageId you got back to save_page with edits [{find, replace}] (all apply or none do) or the whole new source; pass only pageId to read the current source.

## Design rules
- Show, don't narrate: pick the richest component that fits the data. Numbers become Metrics, trends a LineChart, comparisons Bars, shares a Pie, flows a Diagram, sequences Steps, options ProsCons, statuses toned Status pills. A paragraph is for the one thing a visual cannot say.
- Lead with the answer: a Callout (lead + tone) or Metrics first, evidence below. The reader should get the point in two seconds.
- Long pages (five or more sections) start with a TableOfContents whose ids match the Section ids. Number sections in reading order when the order matters.
- Avoid walls of text and walls of identical cards: mix open sections, a Grid of two or three cells and one or two tables. Break prose into BulletList / NumberedList items.
- Colour comes from the kit and useTheme: no hex colours, no gradients or glows, no emoji as icons or bullets. Tones (success, warning, danger, info) are for meaning, not decoration.
- Every chart sits in a Section with a heading and, when useful, a caption naming the unit, the period and the source. Omit a section rather than show empty data or placeholder text.
- A LineChart axis starts at 0 unless floor is set: for a narrow range (3.05% to 3.41%) set floor and ceiling just around the data. Chart series take palette colours in order, never tones; to make a part mean "failed", put that colour first with Page palette (from useTheme).
- Custom SVG with text gets a fixed width and height plus style={{maxWidth: "100%"}}; a small viewBox at width "100%" scales its text with the page.
- End research with LinkCards of the sources (site and date), after a Divider.

## Recipes
- Dashboard (width "wide"): Section with a Segmented period switch in actions -> Metrics -> Grid of two charts -> Table with toned Status cells -> Callout with the takeaway.
- Report or research dossier: TableOfContents -> Callout summary (lead + tone) -> numbered Sections, each a short Text plus a Table, Bars or BulletList -> Quote for primary evidence -> ProsCons for trade-offs -> Divider -> LinkCards (numbered) of sources -> Footnote for method notes.
- Tracker: Metrics of progress -> Checklist or Rows with Status -> Steps for what is next -> Properties for owners and dates.
- Plan: Callout with the goal -> Steps or a Diagram of the phases -> Table of milestones with Status -> NumberedList of open questions.
- Long reference: TableOfContents -> collapsible Sections (collapsible, defaultOpen for the first) so the reader opens what they need.

## Components
Text props and list items accept **bold**, *italic* or _italic_, \`code\` and bare https:// or www. links. Tones: "success" | "warning" | "danger" | "accent" | "info".

### Structure
- Page {title, summary?, width?: "column" | "wide" | "full", lang?, palette?: [colour], sources?: [url]}: the page. "column" (default) for reading, "wide" for dashboards; palette replaces the first chart colours; sources become a footer of links. lang is the content's language tag ("fr", "he"); the kit's own buttons, empty states, dates and numbers follow it, and Hebrew or Arabic read right to left. A PageHero given first sits above the title.
- PageHero {eyebrow?, eyebrowMark?}: a small label and any art above the title. PageMeta: a byline or date line. Footnote: a small trailing note.
- Section {heading?, id?, caption?, actions?, collapsible?, defaultOpen?}: a block with a heading; nesting steps the heading down a level; inside a Grid it becomes a card. id (else the heading) is the anchor a TableOfContents links to. caption sits under the first table or chart, else under the first block. actions sits on the heading line (put a Segmented there). collapsible folds it behind its heading, closed unless defaultOpen.
- TableOfContents {items: [{label, id, depth?}], title?}: "On this page" links that follow the reader's position; long lists fold, phones get a compact menu.
- Grid {columns}: side by side (1 to 4 columns); stacks on phones.
- Divider: a hairline between parts. Floating {edge?: "bottom" | "top", align?: "start" | "center" | "end", bar?}: a row of controls pinned while scrolling. BackToTop {label?}: a button back to the top.

### Text and lists
- Text: a paragraph. Callout {lead?, tone?}: a tinted note; children are the body.
- Quote {cite?}: a quotation with its source.
- BulletList {items, marker?: "pro" | "con"} and NumberedList {items}: an item is a string or {text, items?} for a nested list.
- ProsCons {pros, cons, prosHeading?, consHeading?}: two cards of plus and minus points.
- LinkCards {links: [{title, href, site?, date?}], numbered?}: a list of sources or related pages; the site defaults to the link's address.
- Legend {names: [string], comparison?: [index], dots?}: series names in chart colours, for a custom visual; comparison lists indexes of names drawn as grey dashed lines.

### Math
- Equation {label?}: a centred formula; children are terms. Frac {num, den}, Pow {base, exp}, Sqrt, Sum {from?, to?, sign?}, Paren {open?, close?}. Example: <Equation label="Break-even">Sales = <Frac num="fixed costs" den="margin" /></Equation>.

### Data
- Metrics {metrics: [{value, label, detail?, tone?, delta?, better?, trend?}]}: headline numbers, up to four a row; tone colours the detail. delta ("+12%" or -3) adds an up or down mark, green when it moves the good way (better: "up" default, or "down" for churn and cost); trend (numbers) adds a small line under the figure.
- Properties {items: [{label, value}]}: label and value pairs; value may be a Status.
- Status {tone?}: a short status word in a tinted pill, e.g. <Status tone="success">Shipped</Status>; tone "neutral" or none is grey.
- Rows {rows: [{title, lead?, detail?, meta?, status?: {label, tone}}]}: a list; lead sits in a narrow column before the title, the status follows the title in its tone, meta sits at the right.
- Steps {steps: [{title, detail?}]}: a numbered sequence. Checklist {items: [{text, done, meta?}]}: read-only progress.
- Table {columns: string[], rows: cell[][], align?: ("auto" | "start" | "end" | "center")[], emphasis?: column, sortable?: boolean}: a cell is text, a number, {text, tone?} or a Status. Figures and single short words align to the end. Wide tables scroll sideways; long ones get a filter box and a sticky header; sortable makes headers sort.

### Charts
- LineChart {points: [{label, value}], floor?, ceiling?, unit?, format?: (n) => string, labels?: [seriesName], lines?: [{label, values}], secondary?: {label, values}, annotations?: [{at: index | "zero", label}], legend?}: a trend; one series gets an area fill, lines add series, secondary adds a grey dashed comparison. A missing value leaves a gap.
- Bars {bars: [{label, value, display?}], emphasis?: index | "none"}: horizontal bars; the longest is highlighted unless you choose. Negative values draw red.
- Columns {points: [{label, value, display?}], emphasis?}: vertical columns with their value on top, for a few periods or categories; values are 0 or more, so chart losses or other negatives with Bars.
- ColumnSeries {labels: string[], series: [{name, values}], stacked?, unit?, format?, ceiling?, reference?: {value, label}, legend?}: several series per label, side by side or stacked.
- StackedBars {series: string[], bars: [{label, values, display?}]}: one horizontal bar per row split into named parts.
- Pie {parts: [{label, value, display?}], total?: true | text, label?}: a donut of the parts of one whole, listed with their share; total puts the sum (or your text) in the middle over label.
- Scatter {points: [{x, y, size?, label?, series?}], x?: {name, unit, format, floor, ceiling}, y?: {...}, size?: {name}, trend?, legend?}: two measures against each other; trend draws a fitted line and labels points far off it.
- Heatmap {rows: string[], columns: string[], values: number[][], max?}: a grid shaded by value, such as weekday by hour.
- CalendarHeatmap {days: [{date: "YYYY-MM-DD", value}], from?, to?, max?, note?}: daily activity in week columns.
- Venn {sets: [{label, count?, items?}], overlap?}: two or three overlapping groups.
- Matrix2x2 {axes: {x: [low, high], y: [low, high]}, quadrants: [topLeft, topRight, bottomLeft, bottomRight], points: [{label, x, y}]}: items placed from 0 to 1 on two axes.
- SourceStamp {source}: when data was read, "As of Oct 30, 2026" for a snapshot or "Updated 3 min ago" when live.
- Diagram {nodes: [{id, label, detail?, kind?: "box" | "terminal", series?: 0..4}], edges: [{from, to, label?, dashed?}], direction?: "vertical" | "horizontal"}: a flow laid out automatically.
LineChart, Columns, ColumnSeries, Scatter, Heatmap and CalendarHeatmap show exact values on hover and with the arrow keys once focused; Bars, Pie, StackedBars, Venn, Matrix2x2 and Diagram print theirs, so put every figure a reader needs in their labels or display text. Give each a Section heading and say the unit in the heading, caption or unit prop.

### Controls
- Segmented {options: (string | {value, label, count?})[], value, onChange}: tabs for switching views. Wraps onto more lines; the chosen tab always shows.
Keep each control's value in useState. A control placed straight in a Section or Grid is compact; inside your own element it is full size.
- Button {label, onClick, variant?: "quiet" | "primary", disabled?}: one primary per group.
- Select {label?, options: [{value, label}], value, onChange, placeholder?, disabled?}. Input {label?, value, onChange, placeholder?, type?: "text" | "number" | "search"}.
- Toggle {label, value, onChange, disabled?}. Checkbox {label, value}: shows a recorded yes or no; the reader cannot change it, so things the reader ticks off are Toggles. A number the reader steps (servings, quantity) is a row of Button "−", the value and Button "+". Input has no Enter or submit event: act on onChange, or put a Button beside it.
- LinkButton {label, href, variant?: "button" | "text"} and TextLink {href, children}: web or mail links, opened by the app.
- CopyButton {label, text?, copiedLabel?}: copies text (else the label) and shows "Copied"; where copying is blocked it shows the text to select. For your own copy buttons call copyText(text), which resolves true once copied; navigator.clipboard is blocked in pages.
- ReplyButton {label, reply?}: puts reply (or the label), up to 300 characters, in the chat's message box for the reader to send. It is inactive where there is no chat, such as a shared page.

### Media
Pictures, sound and video must be embedded as data: URIs (a blob: the page makes itself also works for sound and video); web addresses never load and the component is left out.
- Image {src, alt, caption?, fit?: "cover" | "contain", width?, height?, ratio?: number | "16/9"}: click to enlarge.
- Gallery {photos: [{src, alt}], height?}: up to 8 photos the reader swipes or steps through.
- PhotoStrip {items: [{image, alt?, title?, price?, note?, href?}], tileWidth?, imageHeight?}: a sideways row of small cards.
- Video {src, alt, poster?, caption?, autoplay?, loop?, controls?, ratio?} and Audio {src, alt, caption?, loop?}.

### Calendar
Dates are "YYYY-MM-DD"; times are hours as numbers (13.5 is 1:30 PM). Mark an event selected for the one that matters, free for open time.
- MonthView {month: "YYYY-MM", events: [{date, title, free?, selected?}], today?}: busy days fold into "+N more".
- WeekView {week: first day, start?, end?, events: [{date, start, end, title, free?, selected?}], today?, now?: hour}.
- DayView {start?, end?, events: [{start, end, title, free?, selected?}], mark?: {at: hour}}: events before the mark are crossed out.

### Cards and people
- ProductCard {title, href?, image?, price?, note?, badge?, store?, rating?, reviews?, compact?}: put several in a CardGrid {label?} (a grid) or CardCarousel {label?} (a row that scrolls on phones).
- ProductRows {items: [same fields]}: products as one list card. RatingSummary {rating: 0 to 5, reviews?}.
- WatchCard {title, detail?, label?, reply}: offers to have the bot keep watch, through the chat like ReplyButton.
- Avatar {name, size?, neutral?} and AvatarStack {people: [name or {name}], max?, label?}: initials in a circle; extra people fold into "+N".

### Helpers
- useTheme(): the current theme as values for custom elements: {kind, bg {base, subtle, elevated}, text {primary, secondary, tertiary, accent, success, warning, danger, ...Deep}, fill, border, font, weight, radius, motion, dataviz {categorical, sequential, diverging, other, negative}}. It follows the reader's light or dark mode.
- computeDAGLayout(nodes, edges, {direction?}): the Diagram's layout, for drawing your own flow.
- useSource(id): reads a snapshot declared in a comment that opens the file: "/* page-sources" on the first line, then a JSON object such as {"sales": {"snapshot": {...}, "asOf": "2026-10-30"}}, then "*/". useSource returns {value, asOf, fresh, updating}; nothing refreshes live yet, so fresh is always false. SourceStamp also takes a hand-written {asOf}.

## Example
const data = {
  week: { revenue: "$12,400", users: "398", trend: [42, 51, 47, 63, 58, 71, 66], labels: ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"] },
  month: { revenue: "$48,900", users: "1,640", trend: [210, 245, 232, 268], labels: ["W1", "W2", "W3", "W4"] },
};

function Dashboard() {
  const [period, setPeriod] = useState("week");
  const d = data[period];
  const points = useMemo(() => d.trend.map((value, i) => ({ label: d.labels[i], value })), [d]);
  return (

      <Grid columns={2}>
        <Section heading="Signups" caption="Daily, all sources">

      <Section heading="Launch checklist">
        <Checklist items={[

        ]} />
      </Section>
    </Page>
  );
}
