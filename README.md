![Rakazo — AI teammates you actually own](./docs/readme-hero.png)

Rakazo is an open-source platform for running persistent AI teammates. It is available on the web,
as an Electron desktop app, and through an Expo mobile app. Bring your own model and computer
provider, or run the complete stack locally.

Rakazo is in beta. Learn more at [rakazo.com](https://rakazo.com).

## Features

- Persistent bots with their own conversations, memory, routines, and history
- Shared Team Computers and isolated Private computers
- Browser, terminal, file, and graphical desktop access
- Bots that can delegate to peer bots or short-lived subagents
- Bring-your-own model credentials through Pi
- Optional app integrations through Composio
- Docker, E2B, Daytona, and trusted local-computer support

## Demo

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dccdeddb-2134-4a56-8eed-b2e591736b1c

## Stack

- TypeScript
- React 19, Vite, and Tailwind CSS
- Electron and Expo
- Hono and oRPC
- PostgreSQL and Prisma
- Better Auth
- Graphile Worker
- Pi
- Docker, E2B, and Daytona
- Composio

## Quick start

You need Node.js 22+, pnpm 9, and Docker Desktop.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elie222/rakazo.git
cd rakazo
cp .env.example .env
```

Set `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` and `ENCRYPTION_KEY` in `.env` to independent, long random values. You can
also set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, or connect a supported model provider during onboarding.

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env -f infra/compose/docker-compose.yml up postgres -d
pnpm install
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm sandbox:build
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:5173](http://127.0.0.1:5173), create an account, connect a model, and create
your first bot.

For an agent-assisted installation, use [SETUP_PROMPT.md](./SETUP_PROMPT.md). For deployment,
provider selection, backups, and upgrades, see the [self-hosting guide](./docs/self-host.md).

## Desktop and mobile

The Electron and Expo apps are clients of the same Rakazo API used by the web app.

With the development stack running, launch Electron with:

```bash
pnpm --filter @rakazo/desktop dev
```

Mobile build and release instructions live in [docs/mobile-release.md](./docs/mobile-release.md).

## Development

Rakazo is a TypeScript monorepo built with React, Electron, Expo, Hono, Postgres, Prisma, Graphile
Worker, and Pi.

Common checks:

```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the development workflow and test matrix.

## Documentation

```bash
pnpm test              # unit, property, and in-process contract tests
pnpm test:integration  # Postgres journeys, Graphile jobs, LISTEN/NOTIFY
pnpm test:e2e          # Playwright against the emulated stack
pnpm test:e2e -- --sandbox=e2b # the same deterministic suite against real E2B
pnpm test:e2e -- --sandbox=daytona # the same suite against real Daytona
pnpm test:e2e -- --sandbox=box # the same suite against real Box
pnpm test:topology     # local Docker + Graphile worker recovery (needs Docker)
pnpm test:canary       # live OpenRouter / E2B / Box canaries
# explicit real vision-model + real E2B desktop acceptance test:
COMPUTER_E2E_MODEL=<vision-capable-openrouter-model-id> pnpm test:computer

## Contributing

The Playwright workflow can also be started manually with **Sandbox provider** set to `e2b`, `daytona`, or `box`.
Those options require `E2B_API_KEY`, `DAYTONA_API_KEY`, or `BOX_API_KEY`, keep the deterministic scripted agent runtime, and destroy
the provider machines after the run. The default and all automatic runs remain on `fake`.
